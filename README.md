## Accessibility & Known Issues

- **Accessibility:**
  - Forms are labeled with `for` attributes
  - Buttons are focusable via keyboard
  - Color contrast checked for text readability
- **Known Issues:**
  - Vue version: Ticket editing state sometimes does not update immediately
  - React version: None significant at this time
  - Both versions: No backend, data resets on page reload

---

## Example Test User Credentials

> No authentication is implemented, but you can simulate user input:

- **Test User 1:**

  - Name: `Test User`
  - Email: `test@example.com`

- Use any ticket title/description for testing ticket creation.
