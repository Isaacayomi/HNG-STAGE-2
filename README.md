## UI Components & State Structure

### React Version

- **TicketContext.js:** Centralized state for tickets, form data, and editing status
- **Components:**
  - `TicketForm` – Create & edit tickets
  - `TicketList` – Displays all tickets
  - `TicketItem` – Individual ticket with edit/delete buttons
  - `TicketStats` – Bar chart for ticket statistics
- **State:**
  - `tickets` – Array of ticket objects
  - `form` – Current ticket input values
  - `editing` – Currently editing ticket ID
  - `message` – Notification messages

### Vue Version

- **Reactive State:**
  - `tickets` – Reactive array of tickets
  - `form` – Current input values
  - `editing` – Currently editing ticket ID
- **Components:**
  - `TicketForm.vue` – Ticket creation & editing
  - `TicketList.vue` – List of tickets
  - `TicketItem.vue` – Individual ticket actions
  - `TicketStats.vue` – ApexCharts bar chart for ticket statistics

---

## Accessibility & Known Issues

- **Accessibility:**
  - Forms are labeled with `for` attributes
  - Buttons are focusable via keyboard
  - Color contrast checked for text readability
- **Known Issues:**
  - Vue version: Ticket editing state sometimes does not update immediately
  - React version: None significant at this time
  - Both versions: No backend, data resets on page reload

---

## Example Test User Credentials

> No authentication is implemented, but you can simulate user input:

- **Test User 1:**

  - Name: `Test User`
  - Email: `test@example.com`

- Use any ticket title/description for testing ticket creation.
