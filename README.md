# Modern Ticket Management App üé´

A sleek and efficient Ticket Management application built with modern web technologies. This repository showcases two distinct frontend implementations‚Äîone using **React** and the other **Vue.js**‚Äîboth demonstrating best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and responsive design.

## Description

This project provides a complete solution for tracking and managing support tickets. Users can register, log in, and access a dashboard to create, view, update, and delete tickets. The application features an intuitive user interface, data visualizations for ticket analytics, and a seamless user experience, all powered by local storage for persistent data without a backend.

The dual-framework approach makes this an excellent project for comparing and contrasting React (with Context API) and Vue.js (with Pinia) for state management and application structure.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Dual Frameworks**: Full implementations in both **React** and **Vue.js**.
-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality (simulated with local storage).
-   **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for tickets.
-   **Interactive Dashboard**: A comprehensive overview of ticket statistics with beautiful charts and graphs.
-   **State Management**: Utilizes React Context API and Vue's Pinia for robust and scalable state management.
-   **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first, fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Component-Based Architecture**: Well-structured, reusable, and maintainable components.
